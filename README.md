A 8 tile puzzle consists of 3x3 maze in which numbers 1-8 are arranged randomly and 1 cell is blank.
The blank cell can be swapped with any of its adjacent cells.
The aim is to arrange all cells sequentially in order by moing the blank cell accordingly.

This is one of the most popular puzzle for implementing search techniques like A* search, IDS search , depth first search etc.

This Repo implements Iterative Deepening Search which uses recursive Iterative Deepening Search which checks for solution from depth 0 to 
certain threshold depth.
